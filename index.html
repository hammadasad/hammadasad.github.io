                  <h3>About me</h3>
                  <p>Hi! <br>
                  I'm Hammad and I'm student at Carleton University who's studying computer science.
                  I'm also currently doing a co-op work term at Ericsson as a software developer.
                  I love to lift,
                  play sports, listen to music, game and expand my knowledge. My dream career goal
                  is to work on leading-edge technologies that would have a large impact on the way
                  our society operates. I'm also interested in e-commerce and IT consulting.
                  If you'd like to know more, just ask :)
                  </p>

                  <h3>Why CS?</h3>
                  <p>Back in high school, I wasn't sure about what I wanted as my future career.
                  I've always been a fan of cyberpunk and love futuristic art. Radio telescopes
                  also looked cool to me and the idea of possibly working on one motivated me to
                  enroll into the communications engineering program. My curriculumn differed
                  from the electrical engineering one because we were exposed to more low-level
                  software courses. After completing my second year, I decied to switch
                  into computer science
                  because I preferred the software aspect over the hardware.
                  I did a lot of research before the switch and initially looked into
                  going into the software engineering stream instead.
                  I also did a summer internship
                  right before where I was first exposed to real software development. All of this
                  factored my decision to switch.
                  So far, I can say that going into CS was one of the best decisions of my life.

                  <h3>Why make this?</h3>
                  <p>To learn. A few of my friends had just compeleted 12-month work terms
                    and I asked them of how they spent their off-work time. Most of them didn't
                    get much accomplished because they were exhausted from work. They all mentioned
                    that they wish they had spent more time learning new skills, coding and
                    uncovering old hobbies. I decided that I want to be productive with my leisure time.
                    Making this static webpage is a start and has allowed me to develop my HTML5 and CSS3 knowledge.
                    Building this has also forced me to use the Bootstrap framework to allow me to
                    space out columns and make the page look cleaner.
