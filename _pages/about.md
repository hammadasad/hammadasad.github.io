Hi! I'm Hammad

I'm an ambitious 4th year computer science student at Carleton University. I have previously worked as an intern at Ericsson and with 2 other startups.

I love engaging learning experiences, brainstorming and building. I'm mainly interested in embedded systems, artificial intelligence, computer vision and the web. I'm also recently finding myself more interested in computer systems security (potential honors project subject?). 

When I have time, I like to participate in hackathons. Always an awesome experience.

On the side, I hold interests in a wide amounts of activities. A few are fitness, travelling, photography, culinary art, entreprenuership, history, sketching, music and dancing. I'm always excited to try new things and gain knowledge. I am currently trying to focus on swimming, reading more books and making stuff with the Arduino and wearables.

Other facts about me:
 - I'm an ENTP
 - I'm a minimalist 
 - I'm really good at fighting games
 - I love cake and chocolate
